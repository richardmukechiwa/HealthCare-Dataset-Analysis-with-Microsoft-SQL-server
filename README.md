# HealthCare-Database-Analysis-with-Microsoft-SQL-server
#### This project is about analysing a dataset about patients, medical conditions,  appointments, the  prescriptions and the respective doctors who attended to the appointments.
#### The analysis covers simple, intermediate and advanced SQL skills.
#### The database was provided by Dr Eyo and this is the link to his X page where he talks about the free copy https://x.com/Eyowhite3/status/1726883774640562366

#### I have come up with this questions for the analysis:

- Retrieve all appointments with their respective patient details (first name, last name).
- Find the total number of appointments made.
- List all doctors along with their specializations.
- Retrieve patients who are male and were born before 1980.
- Get the count of appointments for each doctor.
- Find doctors who prescribed medications and their respective medication count.
- List appointments scheduled for pediatricians.
- Identify patients who have appointments for child-related issues and the medications they are prescribed.
- Find doctors who prescribed medications that are expiring within the next 30 days.
- Retrieve patients who haven't had any appointments.
